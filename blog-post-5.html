            <h1>Gaining Practical Skills in CSS and Modern Web Design</h1>
            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            This week expanded CSS abilities and provided insights into current web design practices.

                The CSS lecture demonstrated styling page elements by adjusting properties like borders and margins. Seeing the box model in dev tools helped understand the concepts. It provided experience setting up a VS Code project, linking CSS files, and using selectors to modify HTML tags.</p>
                
                The web design lecture emphasized the need for inclusive, ethical design by adhering to WCAG guidelines. It covered flat design trends, responsive techniques, typography principles, and customer journey mapping.</p>
                
                Understanding user needs is vital in development. Creating detailed personas and flows allows building optimal experiences. The focus on clear visual communication using tools like Venn diagrams was informative.</p>
                
                Overall, the lectures provided essential technical and theoretical knowledge. I now feel capable of styling web pages in CSS while considering user perspectives in design. The coding instruction and design thinking principles offered complementary insights into crafting digital experiences.</p>
                
                Moving forward, I aim to reinforce learning through practice. As we cover advanced CSS, I look forward to using these skills. With a basic understanding in core concepts, I feel prepared to start having a go at upcoming projects. The lectures represented useful stepping stones for acquiring web development skills.</p>
