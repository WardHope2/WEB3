            <h1>Learning About the Course</h1>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
        </p>This being the first lecture for IXXN221, I was able to gauge the content within the course and learn about the main assignments that we would be undertaking during the semester. Those being a research report, a web design project and a journal that we would update weekly to submit at the end of the year. This focused on our ability to understand content and keep track of all we learn.</p>

                As well as this we learnt the importance of user interaction with websites, leading to the introduction of user personas. Having used user personas before for other classes throughout the year I felt competent with the content. It was nice to have a refresher on the key points and information that was crucial for completing the first assignment. Understanding how users interact with websites is key. By creating fictional personas in our first assignment, we as designers can empathize and enhance the user experience.</p>
                
                Listening to the other assignments and getting a brief overview of what the rest of the content for the semester would look like provided insight into the challenges that I had not dealt with before. Having never coded with CSS and having very little experience in CMS made me anxious for the rest of the work after the first assignment.</p>
                
                Having to do coding lectures and classes seemed like a hassle but knowing that I had to do it at some point made it helpful for when the time came. Having had Haowei as a tutor before I was comfortable with the way she teaches classes as well as them being informative and worthwhile week by week.</p> 
                
                As a designer, I find considering the user is crucial. We have a responsibility to develop accessible, ethical sites. I'm eager to explore a way for myself to be a part of that.</p>
