            <h1>Preparing for Assignment 2.2: Coding vs CMS</h1>
            <h2>Week 9</h2>
               This week's lecture gave important details for getting ready for Assignment 2.2, the next part of our design project.</p>

                Having coding or CMS options is good flexibility. I'll try both before picking one.</p>
                
                The guidelines on documenting improvements will direct my process. I now know the parts needed - code/CMS files and a PDF report. Starting CMS builds from blank templates will make sure I can apply the skills I have learnt in this class.</p>
                
                Moving forward, I'll explore coding and CMS platforms to choose the best tool. </p>
                
                Haowei offering support and outlining activities was useful. I will use these opportunities to improve my skills. Asking for feedback will make sure I can get guidance if needed.</p>
                
                Overall, the lecture provided key knowledge to make progress on Assignment 2.2. I have a clear plan and resources to create my website in a way that works for me. I look forward to presenting and explaining my work through upcoming activities. This class marked a step in gaining real-world web design skills.</p>
