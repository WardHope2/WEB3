            <h1>Grasping Core Design Principles and Preparing my Assignment</h1>
            <h2>Week 8</h2>
                This week's web design lecture covered core concepts like composition, visual hierarchy, and affordances that impact user experience. Discussing real website examples highlighted how choices in layout, color, and prioritization affect interactions.</p>

                Learning about mental models and affordances emphasized the importance of users' past experiences in interface design. Well-designed interfaces feel intuitive through clear visual cues.</p>
                
                Reviewing upcoming assignment details was useful preparation. I now understand the required components - wireframes, style guides, iterations, and prototypes. The guidelines on formatting, settings, and presentations clarified requirements.</p>
                
                Moving forward, I will finish working on my assignment and prepare an assignment presentation. Attending other presentations will provide feedback opportunities.</p>
                
                Overall, the lecture provided essential theoretical and practical knowledge for UX design and this assignment. I gained insights to apply principles like visual hierarchy. The discussions, examples, and details have equipped me to craft an effective interface.</p>
                
                With a grounding in core concepts, I look forward to demonstrating skills through this assignment. The presentation will provide valuable practice communicating and explaining choices. I aim to use feedback to refine the work further. The class represented progress in developing technical and communication abilities relevant for UX design.</p>
