            <h1>Gaining Responsive Design Skills and Finalizing Assignment 2.2</h1>
            <h2>Week 10</h2>
            <p>This lecture explained the requirements for finishing Assignment 2.2 and our ongoing blogs. </p>

                Reviewing submission components clarified requirements - I'll include all files and a PDF report. Tips like double-checking accessibility will help make sure my work meets the assignment hand in requirements. The sample blog walkthroughs helped me understand best practices for simplicity, visual appeal, and responsiveness.</p>
                
                Overall, this lecture provided all the information I needed for requirements and allotting work time as the submission date was close.</p>
