            <h2>Week 12</h2>
            This final lecture provided an impactful recap of our 12-week journey while preparing us for real-world applications through the redesign activity. Reviewing assignments and topics helped solidify the knowledge gained in this course.</p>

                Clarifying reflective analysis and visual presentation requirements.</p>
                
                Moving forward, I will complete my assignment, emphasizing visual storytelling and connections to course concepts.</p>
                
                This activity showed how good design requires teamwork, communication, and applied skills. The course has equipped me with theoretical foundations and practical abilities to succeed in UX design.</p>
