            <h1>Finished Assignment 2.2 and Weekly Blogs</h1>
            <h2>Week 11</h2>
            Today's lecture provided important guidance for finishing our projects and keeping up momentum as the course nears the end. Reviewing the requirements made expectations clear. The examples showed best practices for visual designs and reflective journaling that I can use in my own work.</p>

               The workshop and progress check will help me stay on track.</p>
                
                Moving forward, I will make regular journal entries and add visuals for an engaging blog. The GitHub tutorial will inform how I manage versions of my work. For the final presentation, I aim to thoroughly cover my website and design process.</p>
                
                I understand the importance of using feedback and asking for help when needed. Avoiding last-minute work aligns with my goal to gradually improve projects.</p>
                Overall, this lecture balanced summarizing expectations and motivating continued progress. The guidance has prepared me to complete projects, using available help and practicing reflection.</p>
